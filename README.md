  - **Member Access**:
    - View their account balances, invoices, and payment history
    - Submit proof of payment.
- **Accounts Receivable Management**
  - **Invoice Management**:
    - Generate and send invoices to members.
    - Automate recurring invoices for periodic contributions or loans.
    - Track overdue invoices.
  - **Payment Tracking**:

  - **Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., payment details).**
  - **Implement daily automated backups of the database.**
- **Additional Security**
  - **Implement CAPTCHA for form submissions to prevent automated submissions.**
  - **Implement two-factor authentication for account access.**
  - **Implement a password reset mechanism for lost passwords.**

## Development Journey  
A solo or individual project given by my professor, I developed this system to meet the requirements of the **Web System Technologies** subject.

## Technical Stack  
- **Backend**: PHP for API development and server-side logic.  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript and CSS for a responsive and interactive UI.  
- **Database**: MySQL for structured data storage and efficient retrieval.  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on a Infinity. 

This project refined my skills in **full-stack development**, particularly in designing **efficient database structures** and implementing **role-based access control**.
