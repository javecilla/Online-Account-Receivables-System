### PHP 8.2+ Standards

- **Strict Typing**: Always use `declare(strict_types=1);` at the top of PHP files.
- **Modern PHP Features**:
  - Leverage PHP 8.2+ features like readonly classes, enums, and `array_is_list()`.
  - Use typed properties, union types, and match expressions where appropriate.
- **PSR-12 Coding Standards**: Adhere to PSR-12 for consistent code style.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Use PHP's exception handling and logging features.
  - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
  - Employ try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
- **Database Interactions**:
  - Use PDO for secure and efficient database interactions.
  - Prefer prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- **Modular Code**:
  - Organize code into reusable functions.
  - Use prefix name to avoid naming conflicts.
- **Security**:
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
  - Use PHP's built-in functions like `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS.
- **Function, variable and file naming convention**:
  - Use camel_case for both function and variables. `$first_name` or `function get_first_name()`
  - For file use dash like `database-connection.php`

### JavaScript (with jQuery) Standards

- **Modern JavaScript Practices**:
  - Use ES6+ features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.
  - Avoid global variables; use IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) or modules.
- **jQuery Best Practices**:
  - Use jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.
  - Cache jQuery selectors to improve performance.
  - Use event delegation for dynamic elements.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Use `try-catch` blocks for error handling in JavaScript.
  - Log errors to the console for debugging.
- **Modular Code**:
  - Organize JavaScript into reusable functions and modules.
  - Use `$(document).ready()` to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing scripts.
- **Sending Api**:
  - Use the `$.ajax({})` or custom ajax request.

### CSS Standards

- **Modern CSS Practices**:
  - Use Flexbox and Grid for layout design.
  - Prefer CSS variables for reusable values.
  - Use BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for class naming.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Use media queries to ensure compatibility across devices.
  - Design desktop-first.
- **Performance**:
  - Minimize the use of global styles.
  - Avoid overly specific selectors.
  - Use shorthand properties where possible.
- **Utilized Boostrap**:
  - Use existing Bootstrap 5 classes for fast development.
- **Always look for the helpers functions availabe**:
  - Utilized those reusable function in `assets/scripts/*`

### HTML Standards

- **Semantic HTML**:
  - Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
  - Ensure proper use of `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` elements.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Use ARIA attributes for improved accessibility.
  - Ensure all images have `alt` attributes.
- **Performance**:
  - Minimize the use of inline styles and scripts.
  - Use `defer` or `async` attributes for external scripts.
